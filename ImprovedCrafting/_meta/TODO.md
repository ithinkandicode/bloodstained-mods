## General Balancing


### Beast Milk Recipes (MilkofZagan)

The following recipes now require normal Milk:

- Cocoa
- HeavyCream
- CrepeDough
- WhiteSauce
- Flan
- SpongeCake
- StrawberryAuLait
- Smoothie

Only Nectar still needs Beast Milk.

Reason: Beast Milk is a common drop from Zagan (8%),
There are only a couple of Zagan enemies in the game, and a lot of recipes need Beast Milk, or need the food you make with Beast Milk.

It's a common drop, but as there are so few, getting enough Beast Milk means you'll never kill enough of them naturally and farming them is very dull.

### Houndskin Recipes (DemonDogSkin)

Changed DemonDogSkin to {??} in recipes: {??}

Reason: Houndskin is a common (10%) drop from Gieremund, but it's used in 8 recipes (total needed: 15). They're also required in consecutive recipes for boots (Kung Fu Shoes > Battle Boots) and whips (Whip > Thorn Whip) with 2 and 3 needed for each tier. If you're maining whips or boots you'd have to farm 50 Gieremunds with base luck.

Consecutives:

 - Whip (Awhip) > Thorn Whip (Ibarakaswhip)
 - KungFuShoes > BattleBoots

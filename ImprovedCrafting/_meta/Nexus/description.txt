Crafting in Bloodstained is great fun, but...


[color=#6aa84f][size=4]Reduced Alkahest Breakdown Costs[/size][/color]

All items cost half the original Alkahest cost (rounded down, so 9 becomes 4).


[color=#6aa84f][size=4]New Recipe: Alkahest[/size][/color]

Recipe: Bat Fang x1, Melting Skull x1
Makes: Alkahest x 10

The required items are common drops (5%) from Bat and Bone Morte.

Reason: The cost of Alkahest is too prohibitive. You can craft almost anything, it makes sense to craft Alakhest too.

This may have been an originally intended recipe for Alkahest. These are early game items that build up quickly, and they're rarely used in other recipes.
